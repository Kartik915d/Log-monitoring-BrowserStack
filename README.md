# 🧾 Log Monitor for BrowserStack-style Infrastructure

A real-time log monitoring system built with Python and WebSockets to replicate log inspection and observability workflows similar to those at BrowserStack. This tool allows engineers to view live logs from distributed systems, aiding in debugging, incident response, and performance monitoring.

## 🔧 Features

* 🔄 Real-time log streaming via WebSockets
* 🖥️ Web-based client to display logs as they are generated
* 📁 Tail existing log files and broadcast new entries
* ⚙️ Lightweight Python backend for quick deployment and customization
* 🔐 Can be extended with authentication and log filtering mechanisms

## 📦 Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python (asyncio, websockets, aiohttp)
* **Frontend**: HTML/CSS + JavaScript (WebSocket client)
* **Optional**: Docker (for containerized deployment)

## 🚀 Use Cases

* Internal debugging tools for infrastructure teams
* Real-time error tracking and alerting
* Viewing server logs during CI/CD deployments (e.g., BrowserStack pipelines)

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-monitor-browserstack.git
cd log-monitor-browserstack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python server.py

# Open the client (index.html) in your browser
```
